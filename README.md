## Office hours

## Backing Up Your Computer
Computer drives fail, particularly laptops. Back up your work. ‘My computer crashed’ is not an excuse in this class. 

## Help 
If you email me you must use your college email. I ignore other emails and often they end up in the junk folder. Please tell me your name and the class your are in.

If you come by my office either bring a laptop or bring your files on a flash drive. If the problem is significant we’ll go to the computer lab.

I expect you to seek help from others and from me. A tutor from the CS major will be arranged and will be available within a few days. More information will be available.

## Students with Disabilities
The Math and Computer Science department and Western State Colorado University seek to provide reasonable accommodations for all qualified persons with disabilities. This university will adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and guidelines with respect to providing reasonable accommodations as required to afford equal educational opportunity. It is the student’s responsibility to register with Disability Services (x7056, Taylor 302) and to contact the faculty member in a timely fashion to arrange for suitable accommodations. 

## Sexual Harassment
Western State Colorado University has no tolerance for sexual harassment.  If you are aware of, or you have been subjected to, sexual harassment, please contact Chris Luekenga, Associate Vice President for Student Affairs/Title IX Administrator at 970.943.2616, or cluekenga@western.edu. You may also contact the Gunnison Police Department at 970.641.8200. For access to confidential services you may contact the Campus Health Center at 970.943.2482(Counseling) or 970.943.2707(Medical).

## Attendance
I expect you to be on time and regular attendance is expected. No allowance will be made for tardiness or absence. I will take attendance periodically. It will not affect your grade in any way but it you regularly miss class then you lose your right to ask for help outside of class.

## Behavior
You are expected to conduct yourself as an adult. At a minimum you must not disturb the rest of the class.

When I am lecturing or demonstrating techniques, cell phones must be turned off. The only exception is when you are in a possible emergent situation, such as having young children at home or being on the Mountain Rescue Team. If so, set your phone to vibrate and leave the room if you get a call. 

Non-class related or disruptive talk, email, text messaging, web surfing or playing games on a cell phone or computer in my class is not allowed. If I deem it necessary penalties will be assessed, you will lose your right to ask for help and you may be dis-enrolled from the class.

I reserve the right to drop anyone, at any time, from this class for inappropriate behavior. 

## Homework
Homework is an essential part of this course and will be assigned regularly. Homework will be on the GitHub Classroom.  

## Note the following

* homework will be uploaded in GitHub Classroom
* late homework - not accepted
* homework must work
* start early, work hard, check your work!
* groups of two are allowed unless stated otherwise on the assignment. Each student’s name must be part of the name of assignment file name and in required documentation.

## Homework sharing
Learning in this class will depend heavily on your integrity in producing and turning in your own work.  While I encourage you to seek out my help and the help of others, to problem solve as a group and to share ideas, all work turned in must be your own or that of the group you acknowledge working with.  I will consider work yours if you thoroughly understand the concepts and algorithms you employ.  If necessary, I will orally quiz you in this regard.  Students participating in inappropriate homework sharing will have their homework scores significantly reduced, perhaps be advised to withdraw and if necessary given an F. 

## Exams
There will be no exam but the group project will be replaced as the final.

## Grades


Makeup work is not possible.

Grades will be assigned as follows.

94% - A		80% - B-		67% - D+

90% - A-	77% - C+		62% - D

88% - B+	72% - C		        60% - D-

83% - B		70% - C-		less than 60% - F


Other grades given in accordance with college policy. Note that the last day to drop is 1/25 and the last day to withdraw is 3/29. Dropping or withdrawing after these dates is not allowed by school policy. I do not give incomplete except under very exceptional circumstances.

I reserve the right to raise grades based on improvement, etc.  I also reserve the right to modify any aspect of this syllabus except the grading scale by announcement in a regularly scheduled class.

## Group Project
I strongly believe students can learn the Android programming extensively when they actually create an app for release. Students will be divided into small groups with 2 to 5 members. Each team will develop its idea into an actual Android app for release. The deliverables, final presentation, and working app will be evaluated. 

## Integrity of Group Project
Team can reuse any available plug-ins, source code, or framework for its final project. However, the idea must be on your own. There will be no tolerance on copying other project in terms of idea. 

## Standards on Student Behavior and Responsibility
A student in one of my classes is expected to conduct themselves as a mature, responsible person with a genuine desire to succeed in the class.

The student is expected to attend each class on time, and is responsible for all material covered in the class, for all assignments given, and for all exams given during the class.

The student is expected to study an appropriate amount of time, to do all assignments on time, and to seek help when needed in a timely manner.

The student is expected to conduct themselves, in class, in an appropriate manner at all times.

The student is expected to take exams/tests/quizzes at the assigned dates, times and locations.

The student is expected to initiate drops or withdrawals. 

The student is expected to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty.

The student  is expected to have an adequate background for any courses taken, to take courses in a timely manner and to obtain a grade of at least C- in any course used as a pre-requisite in the department.

I may impose additional standards as necessary.

Consequences of failing to meet department standards may include anything from academic penalties, to an instructor initiated withdrawal from the course, to expulsion from the college.
